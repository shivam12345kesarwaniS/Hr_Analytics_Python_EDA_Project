# Hr_Analytics_Python_EDA_Project
 I'm thrilled to share a glimpse of my enriching internship at MeriSkill! 

During this internship, I dived into the realm of HR analytics, working on an insightful project about employee attrition. üíº Exploring data, uncovering patterns, and deriving crucial insights from complex datasets were just some of the highlights.

üîç I got the opportunity to analyze factors influencing attrition rates within the workforce, examining various parameters such as age, gender, department, job role, and more. The visualizations shed light on how these factors interplay in determining attrition trends, contributing immensely to organizational understanding and future strategies.

Understanding attrition drivers, especially when it comes to Overtime, Marital Status, Job Role, and Business Travel, opened a door to comprehensive insights. The experience of diving deep into data analysis and gaining meaningful insights to drive organizational strategies was truly fascinating.
